# ARUD-TESTER
IC’s, the main component of each and every electronic circuit can be used for wide variety of purposes and functions. But sometime due to faulty ICs the circuit doesn’t work. Indeed, it is lot tedious work to debug the circuit and confirm whether the circuiting is creating problem or the IC itself is dead. So, to come up with these sorts of problems IC tester confirm whether the IC under consideration is working properly or not. The digital IC tester is implemented by using the Atmega2560 microcontroller board. The processing of the inputs and outputs is done by the microcontroller. The display part on the microcontroller board is modeled using LCD. After the successful testing of the IC, the result is displayed on the LCD.  The basic function of the digital IC tester is to test a digital IC for correct logical functioning as described in the truth table and/or function table. It can test digital ICs having a maximum of 20 pins. Since it is programmable, any number of ICs can be tested within the constraint of the memory available. This model applies the necessary signals to the inputs of the IC, monitoring the outputs at each stage and comparing them with the outputs in the truth table. Any discrepancy in the functioning of the IC results in a fail indication, displays the faulty and good gates on the LCD. The testing procedure is accomplished with the help of keys present on the main board.
